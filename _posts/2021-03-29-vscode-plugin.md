Announcing the tfsec Visual Studio Code plugin!

![VSCode Plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfsec/vscode-tfsec/master/tfsec-explorer-usage.gif)

The plugin provides an easy way to run tfsec and display the current issues in any easy to navigate view.

If you have checks that are legitimate or need to be ignored for any reason, you can add `#tfsec:ignore:CODE` and tfsec will exclude them from the results. The plugin will resolve codes to their description so you know quickly what is excluded.
