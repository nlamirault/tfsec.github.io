After bringing the infrastructure up and running, go to [http://controller.localhost][http://controller.localhost].

If you don't have an agent running you need to install one.

After successful installation, you will be redirected to the settings page of the controller. [http://controller.localhost/#/settings][http://controller.localhost/#/settings]
