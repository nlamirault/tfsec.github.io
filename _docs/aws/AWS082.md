### Explanation


Default VPC does not have a lot of the critical security features that standard VPC comes with, new resources should not be created in the default VPC and it should not be present in the Terraform.



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS082 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_default_vpc" "default" {
	tags = {
	  Name = "Default VPC"
	}
  }

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS082 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

# no aws default vpc present

{% endhighlight %}
